This is Dan's code from his CMSSW lessons.

First, you should setup an instance of CMSSW_5_3_2_patch4, then check out this stuff into CMSSW_5_3_2_patch4/src/

To compile one of the individual projects, go into its directory and type:
  scram b

Once it's compiled, use cmsRun on the relevant _cfg.py file:
  cmsRun blah_cfg.py

You can figure out the rest. At the moment, I'm too lazy to write a detailed README file for this exercise.
